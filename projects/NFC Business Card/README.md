# NFC Business Card
## A pcb based business card with nfc support
##### The pcb board (88.93mm by 50.8mm) has two layers, the top layer is supposed to be assembled and have the electrical components with a design. On the bottom layer lies the contact information and profile with some cool designs.

## Followed the instructon video provided by maggie (thanks for it), but I have designed it on my own with some inspiration drawn from instructables.
##### its around $30 (with coupon), I have selected the cheapest shipping method (for 12-20 days) so that it could save money!

## Took inspiration from instructables but 90% is designed by me
##### The biggest challenge was routing all connections, but it was fun.
